## Appendix

This appendix serves as a practical reference companion to the chapters of *The Living Practice*. Where the chapters offered narrative, science, and guided exploration, these pages offer structure — tables, protocols, and quick-reference guides designed to support your practice in daily life.

The Relational Protocol Table below consolidates every relational practice introduced across Chapters 4 through 7 into a single reference. Each entry includes the practice name, its primary domain (co-regulation, listening, conflict, parenting), the estimated time required, and the chapter where the full instructions can be found. This table is meant to be consulted in real time — before a difficult conversation, during a parenting crisis, in the middle of a conflict that has gone off the rails.

Additional reference materials include a glossary of key terms, a reading list organized by chapter, and a summary of the somatic markers introduced throughout the book. These are not substitutes for the experiential practices themselves. A map is not the territory. But when you are lost, a map helps.

### Final Note

This book was written in the belief that human beings can change — not through force of will, not through positive thinking, not through any single technique — but through the patient, repeated act of bringing awareness to what is actually happening in the body, in the moment, in the relationship. That belief is not naive. It is grounded in neuroscience, validated by clinical research, and confirmed by the lived experience of practitioners across every contemplative tradition.

If you have made it to this page, you have already begun. The practice is not something you add to your life. It is the quality of attention you bring to the life you already have. Go gently. Go honestly. And when you forget — which you will, daily — simply begin again.
