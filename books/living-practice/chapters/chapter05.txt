## CHAPTER 5: The Listening Body

Most of us listen with our heads. We listen for content — for the words, the argument, the point. Relational presence requires a different kind of listening: listening with the whole body. This means tracking not just what the other person is saying, but what is happening in your own chest, belly, and throat as they speak. It means feeling the resonance.

This chapter presents a complete relational presence protocol — a way of being with another person that goes beyond active listening techniques into genuine somatic attunement. The protocol is simple but demanding: feel your own body while receiving theirs. Do not leave yourself to enter their experience. Do not retreat into yourself to escape it. Stay at the border.

The Listening Body practice is the foundation for every relational chapter that follows. Whether we are talking about conflict, parenting, or working alongside others, the capacity to remain somatically present while another nervous system is expressing itself is the skill beneath all skills.

### The Practice of Dual Awareness

Dual awareness is the ability to track two streams of sensation simultaneously — your own internal state and the felt presence of another person. This is not a metaphor. Research in interpersonal neurobiology shows that experienced practitioners develop measurable increases in interoceptive accuracy during relational encounters.

This section offers a graduated series of practices, beginning with simple partner breathing exercises and building toward the capacity to maintain somatic presence during emotionally charged conversations. The key instruction is always the same: stay in your body while staying in the room.
