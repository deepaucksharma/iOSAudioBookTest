## CHAPTER 8: The Office Loop

Work is where most of us spend the majority of our waking hours, and it is where practice is most easily forgotten. The office — whether a physical building or a home desk — has its own pain body: the ambient anxiety of deadlines, the performative cheerfulness of meetings, the low-grade threat of evaluation that keeps the sympathetic nervous system perpetually simmering.

This chapter examines the specific loops that activate in professional environments. The approval-seeking loop. The perfectionism loop. The imposter loop. The overwork-as-identity loop. These are not character flaws; they are nervous system strategies that were adaptive in earlier contexts — often childhood — and now run automatically in any environment that involves hierarchy and evaluation.

The challenge of practicing at work is that the environment actively discourages it. Slowing down, feeling your body, pausing before responding — these are countercultural acts in most workplaces. And yet work is precisely the domain where practice is most needed, because it is where the gap between insight and behavior is widest.

### Micro-Practices for the Professional Day

You cannot sit in full lotus at your desk. You can, however, feel your feet on the floor before answering an email. You can take one conscious breath before entering a meeting. You can notice the moment your jaw clenches during a performance review.

This section offers a suite of micro-practices designed for the constraints of professional life — brief, invisible, and surprisingly powerful when applied consistently over weeks and months.
