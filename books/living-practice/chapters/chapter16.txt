## CHAPTER 16: The Entrained Room

Something happens when people practice together that does not happen when they practice alone. Heart rates synchronize. Breathing patterns align. Brain waves entrain. The room itself seems to develop a quality — a palpable sense of shared presence that is more than the sum of individual presences. This is not mysticism. It is measurable interpersonal neurobiology.

This chapter explores the power and the pitfalls of group practice. Sangha, congregation, circle, support group — every tradition has recognized that transformation is a collective phenomenon. The nervous system regulates more efficiently in the company of other regulated nervous systems. Shared attention amplifies individual attention. The group field holds what no individual can hold alone.

But group practice also carries risks. The same entrainment that produces collective calm can produce collective hysteria. The same relational field that supports healing can enable abuse. Charismatic leaders exploit group entrainment for their own purposes. This chapter holds both the promise and the shadow of practicing together.

### Building Genuine Containers

What makes a practice group genuinely therapeutic rather than merely social — or worse, subtly coercive? This section examines the elements of healthy group practice: clear boundaries, distributed authority, tolerance of dissent, and the willingness to name what is happening in the room rather than performing consensus.

The practices here are designed for small groups — dyads, triads, and circles of up to twelve — and focus on cultivating the kind of relational field where each nervous system can find its own regulation while remaining connected to the whole.
