## CHAPTER 17: The Structural Body

Not all pain bodies are created equal. Your nervous system does not develop in a vacuum — it develops inside a body that is raced, gendered, classed, and located in specific structures of power. A Black man's nervous system carries a different threat load than a white woman's, not because of any individual failing, but because the environment delivers different signals. This chapter addresses what individual practice cannot fix.

The structural determinants of nervous system health are vast and largely invisible to those who benefit from them. Safe neighborhoods. Reliable food. Access to healthcare. Freedom from police surveillance. The absence of daily microaggressions. These are not luxuries. They are the baseline conditions for a regulated nervous system. When they are absent, the body lives in a state of chronic sympathetic activation that no amount of meditation can fully resolve.

This chapter is not an argument against individual practice. It is an argument against the delusion that individual practice is sufficient. The structural body — the body shaped by systems — requires structural intervention. And those of us who practice from positions of relative privilege have a particular responsibility to see the structures our comfort is built on.

### Practice and Justice

If your practice does not eventually turn you toward the suffering of others, it is incomplete. This is not a political statement. It is a logical extension of everything this book has been saying about interconnected nervous systems. You cannot fully regulate in a dysregulated world. Your calm is borrowed from someone else's crisis unless it moves you toward collective care.

This section explores the intersection of contemplative practice and social engagement — not as separate activities, but as expressions of the same impulse: the refusal to look away from what is.
