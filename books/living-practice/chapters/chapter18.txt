## CHAPTER 18: The Seasons of Practice

Practice is not linear. It does not progress from beginner to intermediate to advanced in a straight line. It moves in seasons — periods of expansion and contraction, engagement and withdrawal, clarity and confusion. Understanding this rhythm is essential, because without it, every fallow period feels like failure and every fruitful period feels like arrival.

This chapter maps the developmental arc of a sustained practice over years and decades. The honeymoon phase, when everything is new and transformative. The disillusionment phase, when the initial magic fades and the real work begins. The integration phase, when practice becomes less dramatic and more ordinary. The deepening phase, when ordinary becomes extraordinary again, in a quieter way.

Each season has its own challenges and its own gifts. The danger is in trying to stay in one season permanently — chasing the honeymoon high, or resigning yourself to the desert. The mature practitioner learns to recognize which season they are in and to offer themselves the specific support that season requires.

### The Myth of Continuous Progress

Western culture is addicted to the growth curve — the upward line, the quarterly improvement, the measurable gain. Practice does not work this way. The most important developments often look like regression. The deepest integrations often feel like stagnation. The breakthroughs often come not during the disciplined periods but during the gaps between them.

This section offers a more organic model of development — one that honors plateaus, respects fallow periods, and recognizes that the nervous system, like any living system, grows in cycles rather than straight lines.
