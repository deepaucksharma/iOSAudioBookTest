## CHAPTER 19: The Aging Brain

The brain you are practicing with is not the brain you started with. Neuroplasticity does not end at twenty-five — that is a myth — but it does change character across the lifespan. The young brain is a rapid learner but an unstable regulator. The aging brain is slower to acquire new patterns but often profoundly better at integration, emotional regulation, and the kind of wisdom that comes from having weathered enough seasons to trust the process.

This chapter addresses the specific opportunities and challenges of practice in the second half of life. As the brain ages, certain capacities decline — processing speed, working memory, the ability to multitask. But other capacities deepen — pattern recognition, emotional granularity, the capacity for equanimity. The aging brain is not a diminished brain. It is a different instrument, and it requires a different kind of practice.

For older practitioners, this chapter offers reassurance: the narrowing of certain cognitive channels often coincides with a widening of the contemplative channel. Many of the world's most revered teachers did their deepest work after sixty. The nervous system, given decades of practice, develops a kind of settled quality that younger practitioners can only glimpse.

### Neurodegeneration and Practice

This section addresses, with honesty and tenderness, the territory of cognitive decline, dementia, and the gradual loss of the faculties that practice has always relied on. What happens to awareness when memory fails? What happens to presence when the prefrontal cortex atrophies? These are not abstract questions for anyone who has watched a parent disappear into Alzheimer's.

The tentative, hopeful answer from contemplative neuroscience is that the deepest layers of practice — the ones encoded not in explicit memory but in the body's felt sense of presence — may be more resilient to neurodegeneration than we once thought. The body remembers what the mind forgets.
