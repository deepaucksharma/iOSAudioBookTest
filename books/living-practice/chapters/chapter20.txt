## CHAPTER 20: The Living Question

This book has moved through many domains — relationships, work, creativity, grief, addiction, pain, aging — and in each one, the instruction has been essentially the same: stay with what is happening. Feel it in the body. Do not rush to fix it. Let the nervous system find its own intelligence. Return, again and again, to the living moment.

But there is a question beneath all of these instructions, and it is a question this book cannot answer for you. It can only help you hold it. The question is: What does it mean to be fully alive in a body that will die? What does it mean to love knowing that loss is built into the structure of love? What does it mean to practice when there is no finish line, no final state, no permanent arrival?

This is the living question. It is not a problem to be solved but a koan to be inhabited. The mature practitioner does not seek the answer. The mature practitioner learns to love the question itself — to let it soften the heart, sharpen the attention, and keep the whole enterprise honest. You are not practicing to get somewhere. You are practicing to be here. And here is always, already, enough.

### The Unfinished Book

Every book about practice is unfinished, because practice is unfinished. These pages end, but the living practice does not. What continues is your willingness to show up — imperfect, uncertain, still carrying the old loops and the old wounds — and to meet what arrives with as much presence as you can muster. That is enough. That has always been enough.

This closing section is not a summary. It is a sending-off — a final invitation to trust your own nervous system, to trust the process of slow change, and to trust that the attention you bring to your life is not wasted, even when it feels like nothing is happening. Something is always happening. The living practice is proof.
