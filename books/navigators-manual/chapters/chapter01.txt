## Chapter 1: You Are Here

This is the foundation chapter — the reader's first encounter with the two-axis framework that organizes the entire book. One axis maps arousal, from deep rest to high activation. The other maps the mode of processing, from tight executive control to broad, diffuse awareness. Together they create a coordinate system for consciousness.

The refined X-axis is introduced here, moving beyond a simple "focused vs. diffuse" binary to acknowledge the gradient of attentional modes the brain actually employs. This refinement matters because it prevents the common mistake of treating meditation as simply "turning off thinking."

### Valence Acknowledgment

The chapter also addresses valence — the felt quality of pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral that colors every moment of experience. Valence is not a third axis but an ever-present overlay, and ignoring it leads to incomplete maps. A high-arousal state can be ecstatic or terrifying; the framework must account for both.

By the end of this chapter the reader should be able to locate their current state on the map with reasonable accuracy. This is the skill everything else depends on: you cannot navigate if you do not know where you are.

The chapter closes with a brief self-assessment exercise, inviting the reader to pause and notice — right now — where they sit on each axis. This is the first of many moments where the book shifts from description to direct experience.
