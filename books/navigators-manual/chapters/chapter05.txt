## Chapter 5: The Carrier Wave

This chapter introduces Phase B — the preparatory breathwork phase that precedes deeper contemplative practice. The central argument is that most people cannot simply sit down and meditate effectively because their nervous system is not in the right starting state. Phase B solves the activation energy problem.

The window of tolerance concept is explained: each person has a band of arousal within which learning, integration, and genuine presence are possible. Too far above the window and the system is in fight-or-flight. Too far below and it is in collapse. Phase B protocols are designed to move the practitioner into this window before asking them to do anything more subtle.

### The Hierarchy of Intervention

A hierarchy of intervention is presented, organizing techniques by their level of physiological directness. At the base are the most body-level tools — breath rate, breath ratio, posture — which require no cognitive sophistication and work even when the thinking mind is overwhelmed. Higher up are attentional techniques that require some baseline calm to execute.

This hierarchy resolves a common frustration: "I know I should just watch my thoughts, but I can't." You cannot watch your thoughts when your heart rate is 120 and your prefrontal cortex is offline. You need a carrier wave first — a physiological foundation on which subtler practices can ride.

The chapter closes by previewing the specific Phase B protocols detailed in Chapters 6 and 7, explaining when to use each and how they relate to the quadrant model from Chapter 4.
