## Chapter 6: The Sigh

This chapter is a deep-dive into the physiological sigh — the double-inhale-followed-by-extended-exhale pattern that is the book's primary down-regulating breathwork tool. The mechanism is traced from the pre-Bötzinger complex in the brainstem through alveolar reinflation to vagal tone enhancement and parasympathetic dominance.

The evidence base is carefully calibrated. The core mechanism — that extended exhales shift autonomic balance toward parasympathetic — is well-established. The specific double-inhale pattern has emerging but not yet definitive evidence from Huberman Lab and collaborators. The chapter is transparent about this gradient of certainty.

### Practical How-To

The practical protocol is laid out with precision: nostril versus mouth breathing options, timing ratios, repetition counts, and the subjective markers that indicate the technique is working. Common errors are addressed — the tendency to force the exhale, to hyperventilate on the inhales, to hold tension in the jaw and shoulders.

The chapter also addresses when not to use the sigh: in states of hypoarousal or collapse, further down-regulation is counterproductive and potentially dangerous. This contraindication connects directly to the Tiger Error discussed in Chapter 8.

Three progressive practice tiers are offered — a single-sigh emergency reset, a five-minute carrier-wave session, and an extended ten-minute protocol suitable for pre-meditation preparation. The reader is encouraged to practice the single sigh dozens of times in low-stakes situations before relying on it in high-stress moments.
