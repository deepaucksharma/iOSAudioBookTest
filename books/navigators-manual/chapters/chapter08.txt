## Chapter 8: The Tiger Error

This chapter addresses the most dangerous mistake a self-guided practitioner can make: misreading a freeze or collapse state as calm, and therefore applying down-regulating techniques to someone who is already below their window of tolerance. The name comes from the animal analogy — the mouse that goes limp in the cat's jaws is not relaxed; it is in dorsal vagal shutdown.

The Tiger Error matters because it looks, from the outside and sometimes from the inside, like the person is already in a meditative state. They are still, quiet, and report feeling "nothing." But the stillness is not presence — it is dissociation. Adding a physiological sigh or NSDR protocol on top of this state pushes the system further into shutdown.

### The Diagnostic Key

A diagnostic key is provided to help readers distinguish genuine low-arousal calm (Q4 presence) from freeze states. Key markers include: the quality of body sensation (warm and textured versus numb and distant), the responsiveness to external stimuli (gentle orienting versus delayed or absent response), and the emotional tone (peaceful versus flat or hollow).

Case vignettes illustrate the distinction in concrete terms. A yoga practitioner who "zones out" during savasana. A meditator who can sit for hours but feels disconnected from life afterward. A trauma survivor who mistakes numbness for equanimity. Each vignette traces the error and its correction.

The chapter establishes The Rule: when in doubt about whether a low-arousal state is calm or collapse, gently increase arousal first. Orienting to the room, standing up, splashing cold water on the face — these simple actions test the system. If the person feels relief and increased presence, they were in collapse. If they feel unnecessary interruption, they were genuinely calm. The cost of the test is trivial; the cost of the error is not.
