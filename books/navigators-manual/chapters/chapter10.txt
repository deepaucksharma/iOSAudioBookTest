## Chapter 10: Look at a Flower Without Naming It

This chapter takes its title from a phrase often attributed to Krishnamurti and uses it as an entry point into the practice of sensory stacking — the deliberate layering of multiple sensory channels into a single field of awareness. The instruction to look without naming is not anti-intellectual; it is a specific attentional maneuver that shifts processing from the conceptual interior of the cortical gradient toward the sensory coastline.

Sensory stacking begins with a single channel — say, vision — and progressively adds others: the sounds in the room, the feeling of air on the skin, the weight of the body in the chair. Each addition broadens the attentional field and increases the bandwidth of present-moment sensory data flowing into awareness.

### The Companion Practice

This chapter is designed as a companion to Chapter 11, which covers interoception. Where Chapter 10 focuses on exteroceptive senses — the five classical channels that report on the external world — Chapter 11 turns the same stacking technique inward. Together they constitute a complete sensory presence practice.

The neuroscience of cross-modal integration is sketched here: how the brain binds information from different senses into a unified perceptual moment, and how deliberate stacking strengthens this binding. The result is a thickening of present-moment experience, a shift from the thin, conceptual now to the rich, textured now.

The chapter includes a guided practice: five minutes of progressive sensory stacking in a natural setting. The reader is walked through each sense in sequence, with reminders to notice the pull toward labeling and narrating, and to gently return to raw sensation each time.
