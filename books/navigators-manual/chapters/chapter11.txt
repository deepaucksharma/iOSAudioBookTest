## Chapter 11: The Inner Body

This chapter turns the sensory stacking technique from Chapter 10 inward, introducing interoception — the sense of the body's internal state. Heartbeat, gut feeling, muscular tension, temperature, the subtle hum of aliveness in the hands and feet: these signals form a continuous stream of data that most people have learned to ignore.

Interoception is not merely a curiosity; it is foundational to emotional awareness. The work of Bud Craig, Antonio Damasio, and others has established that feelings are, in large part, the brain's interpretation of interoceptive signals. To improve interoceptive awareness is therefore to improve emotional granularity — the ability to distinguish between closely related feeling states.

### The Stacking Inward

The companion relationship with Chapter 10 is made explicit: exteroceptive stacking anchors you in the world; interoceptive stacking anchors you in the body. The full presence practice combines both, creating a field of awareness that is simultaneously open to the outer environment and attuned to inner sensation.

Common obstacles are addressed. Many people initially report feeling "nothing" when they turn attention inward. This is rarely true absence of sensation; it is usually low interoceptive sensitivity, which improves rapidly with practice. The chapter normalizes the initial blankness and encourages patience.

A graded interoceptive training protocol is provided: beginning with large, obvious signals (heartbeat after exercise, breath movement in the belly) and progressively moving to subtler channels (the feeling of aliveness in the palms, micro-shifts in gut tension during emotional processing). Each step builds the interoceptive muscle that later chapters will rely on.
