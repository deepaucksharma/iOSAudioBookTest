## Chapter 17: When the Map Isn't Enough

This chapter opens the two-part clinical boundaries sequence with a clear declaration: this book is a map, not a clinician. There are conditions, states, and crises for which self-guided practice is insufficient, and recognizing those boundaries is itself a skill that the book is responsible for teaching.

The 2-Week Rule is introduced as the primary heuristic: if a distressing psychological state persists for more than two weeks despite consistent practice, or if it intensifies during practice, this is a signal to seek professional support. The rule is deliberately conservative — it errs on the side of caution because the cost of unnecessary professional consultation is trivial compared to the cost of delayed treatment.

### Pharmacology and Adverse Effects

The chapter addresses the relationship between contemplative practice and pharmacological treatment with nuance. Medication is not the enemy of meditation, nor is meditation a substitute for medication. For conditions involving neurochemical dysregulation — major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia-spectrum conditions — pharmacology may be necessary to create the physiological foundation on which contemplative practice can even begin.

Adverse effects of meditation and breathwork receive serious, unsensationalized treatment. These include depersonalization, derealization, anxiety amplification, trauma re-emergence, and in rare cases, psychotic episodes. The chapter presents the evidence base for these risks and identifies the populations most vulnerable to them.

The chapter closes with a practical resource section: how to find a therapist familiar with contemplative practice, what to tell a clinician about your meditation practice, and red-flag symptoms that warrant immediate professional contact rather than a two-week wait.
